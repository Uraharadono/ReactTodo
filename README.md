# ReactTodo
Simple pure React web todo list created while I was getting a hold of basic and more advanced concepts of setting up react project.



React learning path:
1.) Brian Holt - Frontend masters - Introduction to React v4
https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v4/
 
2.) Webpack configuration:
- https://www.valentinog.com/blog/webpack-tutorial/
 
3.) Es-lint configuration:

4.) Router for react:
https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start
https://github.com/reacttraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-config
 
This is core library documentation which was a bit confusing to me, so I used some other resources.
 
Here are routes defined in the separate file: https://alligator.io/react/react-router-map-to-routes/
 
5.) Error handling. I had a lot of issues with configuring import syntax for importing scss files then bundling them together. This article is great to get a good grip how to handle css:

This article shows in a way how to do it step by step: https://stevenwestmoreland.com/2018/01/how-to-include-bootstrap-in-your-project-with-webpack.html?fbclid=IwAR0IMbJm5WdMGUOD2fRu0-_8AglnZg57VZ4lKE0dh8s7mjfp0lspibz6lJY
